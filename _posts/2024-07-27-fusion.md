Creating this box felt easier and faster than it would have in tinkercad or freecad. I think it took me about two minutes from start to finish. This experience set me up to think that fusion was much easier than it ended up being later.

I followed the tutorial closely here, and started to experience some frustrations with the software. I am not experienced with it, so it took a second for me to work out what axis plane I was placing things on, and I think they should make the tooltip show what it is when you hover over. I deviated from the curve that I drew slighly by putting a short straight line at the top like the tutorial showed.

This was fairly fast to make, but it would have been easier if I was able to move bodies I create while still having the panel open that lets you change properties like diamater, etc. There may be a way that I don't know about, but I couldn't find it. This is where I started to dislike their move tool because sometimes it just wouldn't work. If something wasn't selected right or I was in the wrong mode (which is easy to miss), it would not move as I expected.

The hat was definitely the hardest object to make. I think I spent more time on making it in fusion than I did in tinkercad. Making the curved brim was especially difficult. In hindsight, I could have made a sketch on the YZ plane that had the curve and extruded that, but instead I spent a lot more time using the cut tool to get the shape. I also had to flip the hat for the render rather than just change the view because it was dark inside the hat. I changed the lighting settings but I could not find a way to get light to shine from the bottom. Fusion feels like a very powerful piece of software with a UX as easy as tinkercad for simple operations. In contrast, freecad is very technical throughout everything you do with it, but does have the benefit of less clicking around on things to move them outside of the sketch view. With more experience I feel like fusion would be the best piece of software out of the three, but I am partial to free and open source software.
