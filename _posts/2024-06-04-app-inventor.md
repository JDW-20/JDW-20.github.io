excerpt: "Making a simple guessing game in App Inventor"
---
When I was using App Inventor, I wanted to learn how to do the following
- Get user input
- Update interface to communicate to user
- Get and set variables
- Use conditional logic

I figured that a guessing game would be a good place to start to achieve these goals. The user interface elements were easy to add, and I was surprised to discover that there is a pretty comprehensive layout system. I was able to scale and position the elements how I wanted. I also had no problems with the code system, although I do prefer being able to type it rather than use blocks. On other introductory educational systems I have used before, like code.org, there was an option to type it as code instead but I could not find a way to do that on here. All of the functions that I needed to make this simple app were available, and organized well in the sidebar, and it did not take long to get the app working. I have an Android phone, so I was testing this app on it, but I will probably install an emulator because the testing process took a while with having to update it on my phone every time. 

To use the app you select a number with the slider, and press the guess button. The label will update with whether you got the correct answer, in which case it will select a new random number. Otherwise, it will tell you if it is too high or low

| Low | Equal | High |
