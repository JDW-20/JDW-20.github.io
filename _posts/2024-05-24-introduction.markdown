## About Me
Hello! My name is Jon, I am a senior majoring in Computer Programming and Applications. I am really excited for this class because many of the assignments are like nothing I've ever done before. I have seen people use CAD software to protoype and build things, but I have never really gotten the chance to do that myself. Most of my experience is with programming, or rather, hitting my PC with a baseball bat until NPM or Cargo or Ruby gems or any of these package managers that modern software development requires actually works. So, most of what I know how to do is very intangible, but 3D printing or CNC fabrication ends up with something that you can actually hold, which is really cool.

Originally, I tried to make this post on WordPress but it took a while to get rid of all the social media links that it insisted on putting on the page. As well as that, I set it all up using a theme that I thought would let me change the colors later but apparently **every** color was Premium, not just <span style="color: blue">blue</span>. So I went looking for other CMS software that is free and found that some work with github pages, so I don't have to pay for hosting. The software I am currently using is called Jekyll, and is the source of my earlier animosity to Ruby gems, since it seemed like every module that I needed to install had to have a different version. I do think the actual CMS is easy to use. It uses css and html for templating, but the actual posts I can write using Markdown and it compiles it into a static site that can go on github pages.

## Some photos
Here are some photos of animals that I've taken in Tallahassee
