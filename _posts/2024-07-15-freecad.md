Following the tutorial was straightforward since it has the best documentation I have ever seen for anything. I had only one problem where I had the view rotated without noticing, and was using the wrong contraint tool (i.e horizontal on a vertical.) FreeCAD was telling me that I had conflicting constraints and no amount of undoing would fix it so I restarted and figured out that it was me and not the program.

The cord of my laptop plugs in to the left side, and that is also the side of my desk that the outlet is on. I made a device that is able to clip on to the side of my desk, and that my cord fits through. I started out by doing the sketch first and using measurements that I took directly, but encountered problems. The first one was that I set the vertical height of the entire device first before making the part that clips on my desk, since that had to be another sketch on the side. This left me without enough vertical space to put the clip section while still having thick enough walls for the device to stay together. It ended up being unreasonably big after I corrected this, so I drew the actual dimensions of the device out on paper to find all the ending lengths, and not just the measurements. I learned from making the tutorial part how to use combinations of padding and pocket to extrude or put a hole in the part. This was really similar to tinkercad with using holes to remove material, but I think I like the freeCAD workflow a lot better. Tinkercad was easier to pick up, but once I knew how to do it with freeCAD, I could do it a lot quicker.

I went through a few different iterations of different ideas for the locking parts. The first idea I had was to make a part that could clip on itself, being both part A and B. This is something that LEGO does well, so I researched the dimensions of the pegs on LEGO and the holes on the bottom to see what works for friction fitting parts. LEGO are made of ABS plastic, which is a very common material for 3D printing filaments, so the concept seemed like it might work. I practiced modeling a LEGO brick, but decided against using this method. Another idea I had was to make a "key" and "lock", where one part is inserted into the other and turned to lock it in place. This is what I ended up designing. It consists of a cylinder with a rectangular piece that can fit through the center of the corrosponding hole on another cylinder. After it clears to the other side, you can rotate it to stop it falling back through. On the side of the part that does not go through the hole, there is a piece larger than the hole to prevent it from going all the way through. Additionally, I added some pegs on the top to lock the rotation of the piece in place. The middle piece of the key is slightly longer than the lock, so the pegs are there to allow the rectangular part to turn but not easily turn back to a position it can fall out of.
