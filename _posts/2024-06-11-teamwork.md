So far, we have gotten the UI of two of the three screens done, as well as some of the code for both, and made an icon. The app is a to-do list, and I am working on the list functionality. App Inventor includes a ListView widget that I have found to be perfect for my purposes. It lets you create a list with text and an image, and to do different actions when you select an item in the list. I have been having some trouble with it, as I use the method that adds an item to the list, but it does not show up when I run the app. I know that the information is being added to the list, because I can output it to a label and see that it is correct, but the ListView does not update even when I call the refresh method. There isn't very much information online about this, unfortunately, and I may have to end up using labels and buttons instead with some kind of paged interface if ListView continues to not work.
