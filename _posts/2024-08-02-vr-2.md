In the Unity store I found a lot of fun things, including some environments. I thought this low poly forest looked cool, so I used it as my platform. I threw a bunch of chairs around on it, and they didn't get placed how I would expect. A lot of them were hovering and did not sit on the surface, but they all hovered a fixed distance away from the floor, so I don't know what is causing that.

I put down a city environment to contrast with the forest and put a bridge connecting the two. In one of the assets I downloaded, there is a rainbow material with some kind of words on it. It kinda reminds me of rainbow road, so it was perfect.

This is the world that I ended up with. I added the snowy terrain and a cabin on the end of the walkway. The walkway is two perpendicular cubes so it glitches out a lot in the middle. Unity does not like what I am doing, and I do not like Unity so we're even.

I wanted to make the player model something more interesting, so I chose something random to test it out. I remember in the lecture it had something to do with a mesh renderer and mesh filter, and it ended up working a little. I could not find a way to move the camera so it was looking from the top and not through the inside of the sofa. The third person controller in the starter pack was no help because it didn't use meshes, it used "avatars". I didn't have any of those besides the one that came with it and searching for avatars on the store didn't get me anything interesting.

The view from inside the couch. Must be missing Counter Strike Source.

The rainbow road. I got lucky with the screenshot and the middle does not appear to be glitching.
