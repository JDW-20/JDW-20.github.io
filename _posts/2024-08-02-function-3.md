This is how the part would look in place. It just hooks through the rings and you attach it with push pins. The rod piece fits into the two end pieces. Theres even a pen holder on the side of both for pens that have clips. 

I made this in blender to try and get it to look really accurate. The STLs that freecad can output can be imported into blender, then I placed it above a plane with the photo as a material and some lights and rendered. Then it crashed my PC. Freecad apparently puts so, so many vertices in what it outputs and blender could'nt handle it. I put a remesh modifier on all the parts and that made it work better.
Please excuse the terrible job I did trying to make the rings go on top. I couldn't think of a better way.

Here is the sliced version. It took a few tries with different settings to make it look right. The slicer really wanted to make the through holes for the push pins wider, and print a cylinder in the middle. I eventually got it to stop. It has lots of supports on it too. Mostly in the side where the rod goes because theres a huge gap. The supports would have to be removed, and some of the sides could use being filed down. At this resolution everything is jagged. I used the recommended settings of 10% infill, 0.3 layer height, and skirt, but I dropped the wall thickness a little and that seems to have fixed most of the problems at 0.6 mm.
