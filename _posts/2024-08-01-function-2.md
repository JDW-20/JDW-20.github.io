I made this in freecad because I actually kind of don't hate it.  I found myself getting more frustrated at fusion than I did freecad. I made measurements of everything I thought was relevant: the length of the rings on the notebook, the diameter of the rings, and the length of the point of a pushpin. Unfortunately I do not own calipers, so I found the diameter I would need by putting something in that fits well and using string and a ruler to get the circumference, then solved for d. The most I struggled on this was when I was trying to use the mirror tool to make both sides of the end piece the same. At the start of the project I put the sketch with a corner at the origin, and so flipping across the origin didn't actually do anything. I had to go back and find a way to reference the center of the sketch to the X axis. Freecad also crashed a lot when I did certain things. I beveled many of the edges so they wouldn't be as sharp. Freecad apparently didn't like reckoning this with doing any actions to the mesh after. I think after this class I have gotten comfortable enough with CAD software, and maybe I will use it to make other parts.
